# Capstone Project 1: Collaborative Web Development

Welcome to your first capstone project! This project is designed to help you apply the skills you've learned so far in HTML and CSS while working collaboratively as a team. Below, you'll find all the details you need to get started.

## Project Overview

Your task is to recreate the design provided in the Figma prototype using **only HTML and CSS**. This project will help you practice structuring a webpage, styling it, and working together as a team to divide tasks effectively.

### Figma Design Link

You can view the design prototype here:

## Objectives

- Recreate the design as closely as possible using HTML and CSS.
- Collaborate as a team to divide tasks and responsibilities.
- Practice writing clean, maintainable, and semantic HTML and CSS code.
- Gain experience working on a project with multiple contributors.

## Guidelines

1. **Collaboration**:

   - Discuss as a team and decide who will work on which parts of the project (e.g., header, footer, sections, etc.).
   - Use this shared repository to manage your codebase. Ensure everyone contributes.

2. **HTML and CSS Only**:

   - You are restricted to using only HTML and CSS for this project. No JavaScript or external frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) are allowed.

3. **Version Control**:

   - Use Git for version control. Commit your changes frequently and write meaningful commit messages.
   - Avoid overwriting each other's work by communicating effectively and using branches if necessary.

4. **Responsiveness**:

   - Ensure the webpage is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

5. **Code Quality**:
   - Write clean, readable, and well-commented code.
   - Use semantic HTML tags where appropriate.

## Deliverables

- A fully functional webpage that matches the Figma design.
- A short presentation (5-10 minutes) will be done at the end of the project by a representative explaining your approach, challenges faced, and how you collaborated as a team.

## Timeline

- There are no srict deadlines for this project, but it is recommended to complete it within 2 weeks.
- Regular check-ins with your team to discuss progress and any challenges faced.
- A final presentation will be scheduled at the end of the project.
